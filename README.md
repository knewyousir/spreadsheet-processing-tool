# spreadsheet-processing-tool  
A spreadsheet data processing tool I wrote in JS for google apps script usage  
  
This script will read in data from a spreadsheet and generate custom spreadsheets
according to specific needs. To use this script with a different set of start/end
dates, different output email target, or a different spreadsheet source, you will
need to update the values of the variables declared in the 'Global vars' section 
below.  
  
Just a note- the standard of JS that can be used in Google Apps Script appears not to support the 'let' type variable. For this reason I used 'var' type variables throughout this script.
